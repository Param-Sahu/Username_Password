# Username_Password </br>
In this program a binary file named "userpassdata.bin" contains dummy data of 24 people in binary form .  </br>
When C++ program runs it will read data from binary file and store data in an string array </br>
If enterred Username and Password are correct then it will display name and enrollment number.</br>
NOTE : Save this binary file "userpassdata.bin" in the same folder with "userpassdata.cpp" while using this C++ program. </br>
In this program I am using binary file because binary file is more secure than normal text files.</br>
I am also providing text file of "userpassdata" for Data . </br>
In the file Column 1 and Column 2 are Usernames and Passwords Respectively.</br>
And Column 4 and Column 5 are Name and Sirname.</br>
Column 5 is Enrollment Number.</br>
I know this is not so great but as a student It was very exciting for me.</br>
This Program will be more better in other programming languages, but I was feeling good by making it by C++ and I am working on it's enhancements.
